# FormOpt-AI
Formopt-AI is a graph neural network (GNN)-based workflow intended to fast-track the iteration process of design to adhere to environmental and context response considerations. The program system explored in this research generates residential buildings through parametric options to later optimize intended factors to a specific target.

<h1 align="left">Introduction</h1>

###

<p align="left">Welcome to FormOpt-AI. FormOpt-AI is a GNN-based machine learning framework for optimizing residential building form in response to environmental analysis and surrounding context. FormOpt-AI aims to accelerate performance-driven design by embedding predictive optimization directly into the workflow and process, with the intended user to be able to easily adapt, like housing authorities and design education or development offices.</p>

###

<p align="left"> FormOpt-AI can be implemented in residential building development in different urban contexts to optimize environmental performance, urban integration, and occupant comfort as critical drivers of design. FormOpt-AI's main advantage over traditional methods is that it is data-driven with scalability across many sites, climates, and building parameters. Traditional methods are time and resource-intensive too, as they require heavy computing power and processing time. </p>

<h2 align="left">Prerequisites</h2>

###

<p align="left"> FormOpt-AI depends on a number of Python libraries, which can be installed automatically from pip install -r requirements.txt. </p>

###

<h2 align="left">How to start using FormOpt-AI</h2>

###

<p align="left"> 1. Start by going through the provided Grasshopper (.gh) script and set up your building parameters, graphical representations, and tabular data (.csv). </p>
<p align="left"> 2. run pip install -r requirements.txt. </p>
<p align="left"> 3. Ensure that your (.csv) files are in your repo-folder and run main.py script. </p>
