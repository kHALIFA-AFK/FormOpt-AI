# FormOpt-AI
Formopt-AI is a graph neural network (GNN)-based workflow intended to fast-track the iteration process of design to adhere to environmental and context response considerations. The program system explored in this research generates residential buildings through parametric options to later optimize intended factors to a specific target.
